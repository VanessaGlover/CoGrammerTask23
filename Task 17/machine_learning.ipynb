The output is based on the input data and the car's internal algorithms, enabling it to navigate safely and efficiently.\n","\n","| 1.2  | User data                 | Viewing history           |The input data provides insights into user preferences, which the recommendation system uses to generate personalised recommendations. The output recommendations aim to enhance user satisfaction and engagement with the Netflix platform.\n","\n","| 1.3  | Pattern                   | Pattern reference         |The input data provides information about the signature's visual characteristics, which the recognition system analyses to determine the signer's identity or authenticity. The output aims to authenticate signatures and prevent fraudulent activities.\n","\n","| 1.4  | Treatment                 | Diagnosis                 |The input data provides comprehensive information about the patient's health status, which the diagnostic system analyses to identify potential diseases or health conditions.

It will then make predictions about the species label of unseen images based on the learned patterns.\n","* 2.4 Classification because can be used to analyse the patient data and learn patterns and relationships that separates patients with and without disease.
